            Tailwind CSS is known as a utility-first CSS framework. A framework
            is a pre-defined set of tools and guidelines that helps you develop
            software more efficiently, quickly, and in a more structured way. A
            utility-first framework provides small, reusable classes — called
            utility classes — that you apply directly in your HTML to style
            elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tailwind CSS focuses on providing utilities to help you build
            interfaces without spending too much time writing custom CSS
            stylesheets. Unlike traditional frameworks, a utility-first approach
            means that each class applies a specific change to the appearance of
            the element. To achieve the desired result, the developer combines
            multiple Tailwind classes directly in the HTML.

            Tailwind allows you to quickly build design prototypes and
            experiment with different looks and layouts. As your design evolves,
            Tailwind CSS lets you organize and group utility classes into custom
            CSS, helping simplify your HTML markup once you've finalized the
            design.
